It seems that there is an opportunity to substantially increase
safety and comfort for people bicycling and walking on Beacon St.
by creating a two-way bicycling (and possibly walking) path along
the median, positioned between the MBTA train tracks and the car
parking spots.  This is the location and route of the "bridle way"
in F.L. and J.C. Olmsted's design for the street (circa 1880's)
and in historical built versions of it.

Where 'omni view' means: these are <!--

   >spherical recordings</a>---

In a suitably modern web browser or mobile-device viewer app.,
you can pan/tilt the virtual camera to change which direction
you're looking.  A rearward perspective is often illuminating.

If the image seems grainy, try changing your player's "Quality"
setting to select one of the "1080s", or better, resolution
variants of the video.  The original recordings were made at
"2160s" (i.e., "4K [HD]") resolution.


[<a id="N1" href="#N1">#N1</a>---]

These early documents focused on one strategy for freeing space
in the median (back-in angled car parking without a dedicated
maneuvering lane) and one alignment of a path in the resultant
space (along the already-paved route, which is curvy at curb
bulb-outs but amenable to definition via flex-posts, largely
without requiring new pavement or repositioning of curbs).

With further study, additional strategies (e.g., narrowing
car travel, turn-queueing, and parking maneuvering lanes) and
additional alignments (e.g., more-straight routes, which exist
at some curb bulb-out locations but which would likely require
some new pavement and/or repositioning of curbs) are explored.
