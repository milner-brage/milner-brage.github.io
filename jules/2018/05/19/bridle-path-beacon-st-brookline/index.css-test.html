It seems that there is an opportunity to substantially increase
safety and comfort for people bicycling and walking on Beacon St.
by creating a two-way bicycling (and possibly walking) path along
the median, positioned between the MBTA train tracks and the car
parking spots.  This is the location and route of the "bridle way"
in F.L. and J.C. Olmsted's design for the street (circa 1880's)
and in historical built versions of it.


Consider:

 -->Concept bottom line</a> (Dec. 9, 2017 - May 7, 2018):

        Summarizes results of CAD modeling and ground-truthing study
        of the feasibility of recreating this median protected path
        (likely initially primarily for bicycling use) over the whole
        of Beacon St. in Brookline.  Especially addresses geometric
        fit and specific challenges to implementation that are
        presented by existing conditions.

        Illustrates this improvement (along with shortened cross-walk
        distances and provision of moderate car traffic calming) by
        updating Mass. DOT's traffic plans for the street's last major
        renovation via a "shrink to fit" cross-section transformation.

        Demonstrates bicycling along the median of Beacon St. as near
        to the historical bridle path route as currently possible,

        (from 12:22 to 12:33 PM, on a Wed.).

        Frames this concept, precedents, and a course of study to
        further develop design and implementation specifics, in order
        to support evaluation and discussion by Beacon St.'s broad
        array of stakeholders.

        Examines the default cross-section of Beacon St., which exists
        at most locations---largely everywhere except intersections.
        Includes values for the street's current built form and also
        for potential forms [<a href="#N1">#N1</a>] that would create a dedicated median
        bicycling (and possibly walking) path.

These early documents focused on one strategy for freeing space
in the median (back-in angled car parking without a dedicated
maneuvering lane) and one alignment of a path in the resultant
space (along the already-paved route, which is curvy at curb
bulb-outs but amenable to definition via flex-posts, largely
without requiring new pavement or repositioning of curbs).

With further study, additional strategies (e.g., narrowing
car travel, turn-queueing, and parking maneuvering lanes) and
additional alignments (e.g., more-straight routes, which exist
at some curb bulb-out locations but which would likely require
some new pavement and/or repositioning of curbs) are explored.
