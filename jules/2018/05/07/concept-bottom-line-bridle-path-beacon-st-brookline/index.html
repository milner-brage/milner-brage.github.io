Since we last spoke about the Beacon St. bridle path restoration
concept at length at a Bicycle Advisory Committee meeting [<a href="#N1">#N1</a>]---

We received, via Town DPW, a copy of Mass. DOT's CAD model for
the last major renovation of the street (<a href="http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/highway/ProjectInfo/ProjectInfoProject.aspx?num=601183"><!--
     -->Highway Project 601183</a>,
which was planned 1995-2004 and executed 2005-2009).

I have prepared an updated version of the model to incorporate a
modern reincarnation of the bridle path for bicycling, per a
version of the "shrink to fit" cross-section geometry that Peter
Furth proposed and Jackson Lynch first refined.

And I have also extended the model to incorporate geometry for
items that were missing (per field measurements bolstered by
aerial survey imagery), such as train-stop shelters and plantings
that have been added since that last major renovation was
completed.


For your consideration, as a result of this work:

(1) (below) 'bottom line' summary re. impacts identified through
    whole-street CAD modeling and ground-truthing study,
    plus proposed take-aways [<a href="#A0">#A0</a>]

(2) (further below) explanation of the updated/extended CAD model:

    [+] revisions made [<a href="#A1">#A1</a>]

    [+] revised cross-section dimensions [<a href="#A2">#A2</a>]

    [+] details of a median bike path alignment to resolve [<a href="#A3">#A3</a>]

             -->printing</a> (as grayscale PDF)


It has been valuable to work through cross-section dimensions,
path bend radii, route obstructions, etc. within the measured
drafting and analysis environment of AutoCAD.

This has yielded both a higher-resolution and more-complete
illustration of the median bike path concept and a demonstration
of the likely degree of the potential path's geometric fit, over
the whole street, and of specific challenges to its implementation
that are presented by existing conditions.

A 'bottom line' summary re. impacts identified through whole-street
CAD modeling and ground-truthing study:

    '''
    When you go searching for a way to improve cycling safety on
    Beacon St., look for a protected two-way path---and also the
    kernel of a linear park---(presently) hidden in plain sight:
    the historical "bridle way" along the median.

    Next to the row of shade trees on the wide side of the train
    tracks, this intrinsic element of the Olmsted's 1890's design
    for the street, and built versions up to the 1930's, awaits
    restoration.
    '''

(+) feasible common cross-section and scheme for achieving it:

    [+] addition of median protected bike path:

            9-ft. wide minimum (and not incl. buffers from parked cars,
            1 to 3 ft. depending upon whether from car bumper or door);

        ... with opportunity for wider path plus a new row of trees via
            9 ft. of add'l width that would be freed if median car parking
            stalls were reoriented from 45-deg.-angled to parallel (which
            incurs an 18% reduction of the total parking supply in a given
            altered block)

    [+] shortening of crossing distances over wide side for people walking
        (and biking):

            by 7.333 - 8.333 ft.

    [+] NO removal of mature shade trees;
        NO alterations on narrow side of street;
        NO alteration of outer-edge curbs on wide side

    [+] retention of all existing street elements, some in shifted positions:

            for people walking across street and along it (from/to median
            car parking), for people dis/embarking and waiting for trains,
            and for car travel (incl. turn queueing lanes) and parking;

        ... with the reductions in width (to supplement the space for the
            existing wide-side car-door-zone bike lane) essentially only
            made in the car elements and, frankly, rather modestly

    [+] provision of moderate car traffic calming on wide side:

            via trimmed total cross-section space for parallel car parking
            plus general travel lanes plus left shoulder that is
            essentially the same as the total for these on narrow side;

        ... and via a trimmed cross-section for the median angled car
            parking space that keeps the dedicated maneuvering lane but
            slightly changes the parking experience: currently there is so
            much space that one generally doesn't even touch the rumble
            strip when backing out, whereas in the proposed design, one
            often would (but one would still be within the space to the
            left/inside of the yellow edge line of the travel lanes);

        ... (where, for further reference, these trimmed car stalls/lanes
            would then be the same as those on the renovated Western Ave.
            in Cambridge, which has parallel car parking on both sides of
            two general travel lanes with no dedicated maneuvering lane
            for either parking row)

    [+] nearly zero car parking loss over the whole length of the street,
        EXCEPT for a possible moderate reduction in the number of stalls
        in two blocks:

            18% reduction of total stall inventory per block,
            between Center/Webster and Harvard Sts. and
            between Charles and Pleasant Sts.;

        ... BUT in recognition of generally slower car travel speeds
            in this area---due to a multitude of cross streets and a
            high-volume of walking traffic---a full-width, dedicated
            median car parking maneuvering lane may not be needed here

        ... in which case, if a half-width maneuvering lane was
            employed, this potential parking loss could be avoided

        ... (and, indeed, perhaps an explicit additional speed-limit
            reduction---to 20 MPH---would be warranted, like Cambridge
            has recently declared in many of their squares)


(+) bike turning movement / walking queueing space scheme---

    provide separate, dedicated space in the median for people walking
    and biking:

    [+] for people biking making turns out of median, via turn queue boxes:

            within the envelope of protection from through traffic of the
            median curbs, possibly within the roadway of cross streets;

        ... and possibly further supported by traffic signal phasing
            ordered so that car left turns from the wide side "lag" the
            the green for the cross street (/ "lead" the green for
            bike/car through travel)

    [+] for people walking, via space outside of the path of any through-
        travel lane---train, bike, or car---to pause before crossing


(+) bike cross-over scheme at wide-side swap and subway-portal locations---

    for now, "walk your bike" portage through each of three small areas:

    [+] crossing Harvard St. and the train tracks in the west end of
        the outbound (east) half of the Coolidge Corner station

    [+] crossing the train tracks at the west end of the
        Washington Square station

    [+] crossing from the outer edge of the street to the median next
        to the St. Mary's St. station


(+) preliminary sense of: the scope of necessary construction /
    results of a median through-travel obstruction survey:

    [+] some addition of pavement is likely needed on the curb bulb-outs
        near many intersections,

        in order to add median bike path lanes in a distinct position from
        (extended/shifted) dedicated space for people waiting in the
        median to walk across the car lanes;

        (ideally this would be paired with removal of nearly the same
        amount of existing concrete paving, which is currently located
        further outset of a preferable median bike path alignment and
        further inset of extended-position cross-walk waiting areas)

    [+] some traffic-signal phase reordering may be needed at some of the
        intersections with car left turns from the wide side

    [+] (having mentioned, above, all of the things NOT modified---)
    
        some reckoning would be beneficial re. intersection or close
        proximity of a good median bike path alignment with some
        obstructions,

        which have been added over the years since the area next to the
        train tracks on the wide side of the street was last used as a
        through-travel space:

        (+) some newly planted (in last 2-10 years) shrubs and immature
            (or non-shade) trees,

        (+) a few train-stop shelters positioned unusually further outset
            than the norm for the street, and

        (+) a few traffic-signal control boxes located in areas then
            thought to be "excess space"


A few proposed take-aways:

(+) It would be beneficial to raise awareness of the bridle-path
    reincarnation concept in Town and to engage a broad array of
    stakeholders in becoming more familiar with the middle part of
    Beacon St. in a new light, so that there is an appreciation of
    this particular space's potential value (and benefit to the whole
    community) beyond current uses.

    E.g.: via demonstrations of protected bike travel space, and
    perhaps "pavement park" programming, by means, say, of reducing or
    suspending car parking in the median along a segment of the street
    for a day or two of a weekend.

(+) It would be beneficial for the Town to further study the design
    engineering, cost, and possible funding of building this
    safety/greenway-character improvement to Beacon St.

(+) It would be worthwhile for the Town to strive not to add any new
    median obstructions to through-travel along a straighter alignment
    (i.e., nearer to the train tracks).

    My sense is that this is about awareness of the possibility of
    restoring the bridle path, e.g.: among folks maintaining and
    making decisions re. tree plantings, traffic signal equipment, and
    parking meter equipment; among folks strategizing re. how/where
    on-street EV (electrically powered motor vehicle) charging
    infrastructure may be added; etc.

[<a id="A1" href="#A1">#A1</a>---]

Revisions made:

    on wide side ONLY---

(+) shift car travel + left-turn queueing lanes
            and median parking stalls and maneuvering lane outward;
    extend median curbs and rumble strip outward:

        (in order to provide dedicated space for a median bike path
        on this [wide] side, via revised cross-section dimensions [<a href="#A2">#A2</a>]---)

    [+] paint revision for lane/stall shifts

    [+] possibly "quick-build" precast "wheel-stop" segments or
        flexible delineator posts for curb extensions?

    [+] to be coordinated (immediately? eventually?) with shifts of
        in-pavement traffic sensors and traffic signal heads on
        overhead arms

    [+] to be coordinated with strategy for median parking meters
        (e.g., just step over the path; switch to more-centralized kiosks)

(+) revise foot/bike path pavement +
                curb ramps on median curb bulb-outs:
            adding these closer to train tracks,
            and (eventually?)
                removing them beside existing curbs 
                and adding them beside newly extended curbs:

        (in order to add median bike path lanes in a distinct position
        from [extended/shifted] dedicated space for people waiting in
        the median to walk across the car lanes [and thus to shorten
        cross-walk distances] on this [wide] side---)

    [+] possibly "quick-build" asphalt for added path pavement +
        asphalt fillet for added curb ramps?

(+) resolve median bike path alignment details:

        (see below [<a href="#A3">#A3</a>])

... i.e.---

    altering wide-side widths and across-street positions of street-
    space elements between the existing outer- and inner-most curbs

    (but possibly retaining the existing median curb lines, for now,
    in case these curb movements might be achieved, at first, via
    flexible delineator posts or wheel-stop curb segments?)

    by performing geometric shifts perpendicular to the street axis


</pre>
<pre class="body">
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


[<a id="A2" href="#A2">#A2</a>---]

Revised cross-section dimensions:

    on wide side ONLY---

(+) car through-travel and turn-queue lanes:

        norm 3.2 m (~ 10.5 ft.);
        very occasional absolute min. 3.05 m (~ 10 ft.)

(+) outer-edge parallel car parking:

        norm 2.25 m (~ 7.5 ft.), and not-infrequently ~ 0.15 m more;
        very occasional absolute min. 2.1 m (~ 7 ft.)

        (NB: the norm here [0.3 m (~ 0.5 ft.) larger than perhaps we
             would prefer] was chosen so as ensure 0.3 m [~ 1 ft.]
             clearance from existing outer-edge curb bulb-outs,
             so that none should need to be altered)

(+) outer-edge and median shoulder
            (curb bulb-out and rumble-strip shy distance):

        0.3 m (~ 1 ft.)

(+) median 45-deg.-angled car parking plus dedicated maneuvering lane:

        norm 8.7 m (~ 28.5 ft.);
        extremely occasional absolute min. 8.55 m (~ 28 ft.)

(+) median parallel car parking plus dedicated maneuvering lane:

        norm 5.3 m (~ 17.5 ft.);
        extremely occasional absolute min. 5.15 m (~ 17 ft.)

    ... plus buffer on curb side:

        0.9 m (~ 3 ft.)

(+) median rumble strip
            (along outward edge of car parking maneuvering lane,
            inset of lane line by aforementioned shoulder/shy distance):

        dimension not altered, for now---

        1.0 m (~ 3.333 ft.);
        extremely occasional absolute min. 0.5 m (~ 1.667 ft.)

        (NB: could this, possibly, be narrowed to a new norm of,
             e.g., 0.6 m [~ 2 ft.], which would be a reduction
             proportional to that done for shoulders [from 0.5 m,
             minus 0.2 m]? or could it be removed?)

(+) NEW median bike path:

        2.75 m (~ 9 ft.)

    ... plus buffer from parked cars:

            0.3 m (~ 1 ft.) for 45-deg.-angled (front bumpers),
        OR  0.9 m (~ 3 ft.) for parallel (side doors)

[<a id="A3" href="#A3">#A3</a>---]

Details of a median bike path alignment to resolve:

(+) median car parking stall siting:

        NO broad removal of stalls, EXCEPT---

    [+] between Centre/Webster St. and Harvard St.:

            possible loss of 7 stalls (of 16 existing),

            due to conversion from 45-deg.-angled to parallel orientation

                (because the 1.5 m [~ 5 ft.] of space that elsewhere was
                allocated to a car-door-zone [outer-edge] bike lane, here
                was allocated to a median sidewalk to/from the Coolidge
                Corner train station instead)

                (and because the parallel conversion frees more space than
                needed to make the new median bike path whole, at 2.75 m
                [~ 9 ft.] wide, the excess ~ 1.2 m [~ 4 ft.] yielded is
                modeled as allocated to widen that median sidewalk)

            BUT if a half-width maneuvering lane was employed, in
            recognition of generally slower car travel speeds in this
            area, this potential parking loss could be avoided

    [+] between Charles St. and Pleasant St.:

            possible loss of between 5 and 7 stalls (of 16 existing),

            due to the need, it seems, to angle general-purpose car lanes
            inward, into the space occupied by the dedicated median car
            parking maneuvering lane

                (because:
                [+] the existing car-door-zone bike lane unceremoniously
                    ended at the western leg of the Pleasant St.
                    intersection as the means for blending the wide-
                    vs. narrow-side width / across-street-position
                    regimes of the car lanes;
                [+] the Pleasant St. 'triangle' people refuge tightly
                    constrains the car lanes on their right side
                    [occupying the outer-edge space that just eastward is
                    devoted to parallel car parking stalls]; and
                [+] the outer-edge sidewalk just west of Pleasant St. was
                    made unusually wide---5.3 m [~ 17.5 ft.], rather than
                    the norm of 4.6 m [~ 15 ft.])

            and going forward, we need to blend the width and across-
            street position of the car lanes here---

            the space for this could be provided, it seems, by either:
            [-] keeping the block's car parking 45-deg. angled and
                eliminating the stalls opposite the Pleasant St. triangle
                to eliminate the conflict between the general-purpose car
                lanes, as they angle, and the dedicated median car parking
                maneuvering lane (and to form a new planting and/or people
                space beside the new median bike path);
            ... OR ...
            [-] converting the block's car parking to parallel, and
                devoting the excess space freed to form a planting buffer
                beside the new median bike path (or to form a wider path)
                to absorb narrowing from east to west, as the
                general-purpose car lanes angle south

            the first option is modeled, for now;

            BUT if a half-width maneuvering lane was employed, in
            recognition of generally slower car travel speeds in this
            area, this potential parking loss could be avoided

    [+] between Winchester St. and Centre/Webster St.:

            loss of 1 stall (of 8 existing),

            due to extension of Winchester St. curb bulb-out

                (in order to fully protect the angled car parking
                maneuvering lane from through-travelers turning from
                Winchester St. [which intersects at an ~ 45-deg. angle])

    [+] between Washington St. and Westbourne Ter.:

            loss of 1 stall (of 5 existing),

            due to merging of duplicate car left-turn and dedicated car
            parking maneuvering lanes;

            BUT 2 new stalls were gained at the *outer edge* of the street
            directly opposite (in front of Athan's)

                (these stalls were included in the original model, but
                have been removed on the actual street at some point
                [or were never actually marked], in order, it seems,
                to widen and smooth the emergence of the car-door-zone
                bike lane here [which is removed in the revised design])

    [+] at Corey/Dean Rd. (west end):

            loss of 1 stall,

            due to a need to clear a mature shade tree that is
            planted very close the curb here

    [+] at Corey/Dean Rd. (west end):

            loss of 1 stall,

            due to a need to clear a street light that is located
            very close to the train stop platform fence here

    [+] at Carlton St. (east end);
        at Hawes St. (east end);
        at Charles St. (east end);
        at Pleasant St. (east end);
        between Lancaster Ter. and Mason Path (mid-block);
        at Summit Path (mid-block);
        between Winthrop Rd. and
            Williston Rd. / Tappan St. (mid-block);
        between Corey/Dean Rd. and Englewood Ave. (mid-block);
        at Ayr Rd. (east end):

            likely TEMPORARY loss of 1 stall in each of these locations
            (8 stalls, in total, spread broadly along the street),

            due to a stall being located incised within a concave space in
            the curb bulb-out at each of these locations

                (that cavity becomes inaccessible to the maneuvering lane,
                once the lane is shifted outward, until the bulb-out's
                curb is rebuilt so that the parking cavity is also shifted
                outward to match the altered stall and maneuvering-lane
                positions)


(+) median train stop shelter siting:

            where the shelter is far outset from the platform at an
            unusually great distance (compared to the norm at most
            stations including, e.g., the major ones: Coolidge Corner,
            Washington Square, and St. Mary's St.):

        should be shifted inward slightly---

    [!] east end of Powell/Kent St.

    [!] west end of St. Paul St.

    [+] at mid-bock between Winthrop Rd. and Williston Rd. / Tappan St.

        possibly should be shifted inward slightly
            (but only beneficial if tree plantings were revised)---

    [?] west end of Corey/Dean Rd.

    [?] west end of Englewood Ave.


(+) median traffic signal control box siting:

            where the control box is closely outset from the 'core'
            planting + train catenary pole + etc. strip (directly next
            to the train tracks):

        likely MUST be shifted inward (or outward or rotated)---

    [!] west end of Pleasant St.

    [!] east end of Harvard St.

        should be shifted inward (or outward or rotated)---

    [!] west end of St. Mary's St.
            (plus 2 new street lights and 1 new car parking meter kiosk)

    [+] west end of Carlton St.

(+) median plant siting:

    [-] in 'core' strip,
                directly next to train tracks:

                locus of almost all shade trees in the median,
                with a good number being mature:

            NO conflict / NO change needed

    [+] in 'bulb-out' beds,
                outset from train tracks, in place of car parking:

                some being bushes, most of the rest seeming to be low,
                non-shade tree varieties, with almost all seeming to
                have been planted in last 2-10 years since last major
                renovation of the street:

            likely MUST be shifted outward---

        (!) east end of Powell/Kent St.: 9 new low trees

        (!) east end of St. Paul St.: 9 new bushy trees

            should be shifted outward---

        (+) west end of Englewood Ave.: 2 new low trees

        (+) west end of Strathmore Rd.: 1 new low tree


(+) traffic signal phase ordering or actuation:

    [+] at intersections where a car left turn from the wide side
        is permitted (from a queueing lane in the median):

            possibly MUST be reordered so that the wide-side car left turn
            phase "lags" the green for the cross street (a.k.a. "leads"
            the green for straight-through bike/walk/car travel)---

            (in order to protect median bike turn queueing boxes located
            in the lanes of cross-streets, within the along-street
            protective envelope of the median curb bulb-outs---)

        (+) Powell/Kent St.:
                WIDE-side car left turn = LAGGING + concurrent

        (+) St. Paul St.:
                narrow-side car left turn = leading + concurrent;
                WIDE-side car left turn = LAGGING + concurrent

        (+) Englewood Ave.:
                narrow-side car left turn = leading + concurrent;
                WIDE-side car left turn = LAGGING + concurrent

            NO conflict / NO change needed---

        (?) Hawes St.:
                wide-side car left turn = leading + concurrent;
                narrow-side car left turn = lagging + concurrent

                ... BUT what about "pre-emption phasing and priority" here?
                    seems like its ordering might swap the wide side to be
                    lagging + concurrent?

        (-) Charles St.:
                narrow-side car left turn = leading + concurrent

        (-) Corey/Dean Rd.:
                wide-side car left turn = leading + concurrent

    [?] at intersections where car travel is not permitted where bike
        travel should be, and/or actuation of non-car (walk + bike)
        phases is disconnected from (not automatically concurrent with)
        car phases:

            may require change to make non-car phase automatic and/or
            addition of push-button for non-car phase request---

        (?) Charles St.:
                south-bound travel lacks car signal, and is on opposite
                end of intersection as the sole south-bound cross-walk

        (?) Pleasant St.:
                north-bound travel is only after walk push-button request

        (?) Winchester St.:
                south-bound travel with cars is disconnected from
                south-bound walk (which is only after push-button request)
