revision as of:
    July 18 - Aug. 13, 2017;
    (minor: Oct. 1 - 14, 2017)

key:

    all dimensions are in ft.;

    re. paint-delimited space,
        dimensions are from center to center of lines;

    toward left (viewed in car direction) = earlier in listing,
        toward right = later in listing;

    '!' =
        point of subtle sharing between walking/bicycling use
        and car use (or walking use and bicycling use);
    '?' =
        undecided point in design

parameters:

    ([vehicle], [action(s)]---)
    (inferred for 'current', maintained for 'POTENTIAL'---)

    bicycle, travel + stop =
        2.5 [wide] (x 6 [long]);

    car, travel + park =
        6.5 [wide] (x 17 [long]);

    package delivery truck [<a href="#N4">#N4</a>],
            travel + park
                (BUT non-conforming to stalls, re.:
                     angle (&#60; stall) [where angled]
                       / length (> stall) [where parallel]) =
        (8 [wide] x) 22.5 [long];

    fire truck, travel =
        10 [wide]

    viewed perpendicular to curb (above);

    viewed parallel to curb:
        12 [each stall];
    BUT each stall actually angled 45 deg. to curb:
        {8.5 = (1) + 6.5 + (1)} [wide] x
        {17 + ... (~ 3.5 = 1.5 [RUMBLE] + 2)} [long];

    presuming bumper is NOT overhanging curb;
    BUT may actually BE, e.g.:
        1 [perpendicular] (= ~ 1.5 [angled])
             to 1.5 [perpendicular] (= ~ 2 [angled]);

    if switched to 9 wide (1.25 door buffer on each side =
    net 2.5 between adjacent stalls), then core stall
    perpendicular dimension grows = 18.38 ~ 18.5


[<a id="N2" href="#N2">#N2</a>:]

    perhaps segmented per car-parking stall and, where angled,
    each segment rotated around one of its ends to match the angle
    of `BACK-in-angled car park` (so that the other end of the
    segment projects outward into `car park`)


[<a id="N3" href="#N3">#N3</a>:]

    perhaps a reduction (- 40%) in the number of median parking
    stalls (due to their orientation in this option) would be deemed
    necessary and acceptable along some Beacon St. segments

    (i.e., shortly before/after a major cross-street intersection,
    esp. where additionally cross-cut by other, smaller streets,
    e.g.: Winchester St. to Harvard St., Charles St. to Harvard St.),

    in order to reduce spending time/throughput of the left-hand
    through-travel lane on parking maneuvering (compared to in the
    other option: to perform back-in-angled parking directly from
    that through-travel lane),

    made possible by means of the dedicated parking-maneuvering lane
    in this option (which there is space for, in the cross-section,
    due to the parallel stall orientation here)


[<a id="N4" href="#N4">#N4</a>:]

    e.g.---

    the USPS trucks:

        frequently parked in the median of Beacon St. between Kent/
        Powell St. and Pleasant St. during evenings and weekends,
        which seem to be instances of the 22.5-ft.-long NACTO "DL-23"
        ("package delivery truck") vehicle type---

        would need to be parked at a 30-deg. angle to the curb
        (which would result in their occupying ~ 1.4 marked stalls),
        in order to fit into the same amount of cross-section space as
        a 17-ft.-long vehicle parked at the stall-marked 45-deg. angle
